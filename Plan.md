## Planing for site.
- First divided the project three parts: 
  - API Data fetching and storing
  - Designing the layout and other CSS 
  - Filtering and Pagination

### Tasks implemented
- Create a React APP using `Vite`.
- Fetch data from API using `fetch api` and store data.
- Implement the design provided.
- Pagination and filter.
- Host in Github Pages.

### Tasts to do
Due the short deadline some tasks were not completed.
- Jokes Details page and LIKE/DISLIKE count.
- Jokes search.

### Notes
Some data are missing in APIs like `Joke Title` etc. I use static data in those cases.
